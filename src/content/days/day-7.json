  "morning": "We woke up early so we could finish packing our bags and go to the breakfast buffet early enough to be early to the airport. We went down and had the usual breakfast like normal. After, we went to the reception to check out while our packed luggage was being brought down to the shuttle bus. Finally, we got on the bus loaded with all our items. Unfortunately, halfway to the airport, the hotel staff called us to inform us that someone had left a backpack — and it was Yeshara's! The hotel was very convenient and organised a Grab (taxi) to get the bag and deliver it to us at the airport. That's when we realised we were very late, and there was a very long queue for check-in and security. So we waited in line for at least 30 minutes. In those long minutes, Caitlyn didn't feel so well and started to throw up 🤮. In all that time, the staff didn't even let us go to the front, and she threw up 3 more times! Finally, when we finished security and check-in, we had to run to the gate just to board the plane — 5 seconds before the gate closed. We were the last people to board. Crazy, ain't it!",
