  "morning": "In the morning, we woke up at 7 a.m. and got ready to go to the breakfast buffet. We quickly got a few plates filled with all their delicious food, then we went back upstairs to pack our bags and everything else so we would be very organised and not forget anything. Finally, when we were done, we headed downstairs to the reception to check out. Then we got a few taxis to drop us off at the airport, which took one hour to get there.",

  "evening": "After settling in at our fancy hotel, we went out to explore the famous Hội An night market! The whole riverside was lit up with beautiful lanterns, and there were boats floating on the water with colourful lights. We walked around the market stalls and found a leather shop where we got custom-made leather shoes and wallets for our brothers — all handmade! The atmosphere was magical with all the lantern lights reflecting on the water.",

  "afternoon": "When we finally arrived at the airport after one hour, we went to check-in, which was a very short line. It took about 15 minutes to get to the end of the line. Then, after a line at security, we finally got to the gate where we did some watercolour painting for half an hour. Then we went to the airplane. It was very boring, so I slept during the whole flight. Caitlyn was two rows behind us."
