  "afternoon": "This afternoon, in DIY HOUSE we made clay mirrors, we each did our own unique theme, Shenara did an aesthetic of sunshine daisies with a cute character. Me (Caitlyn), did a pastel gradient with a hint of coquette, Yeashara did a red mushroom woodland nature theme. It was super fun, however, the staff didn't help that much. The clay making took us around 3 hrs to finish moulding the clay into shapes, gluing our cute flowers and characters, and glossing our mirror for our final touch."
