  "morning": "In the morning we had the same breakfast buffet at 9 and while we were eating my mum (Shenara and Yeshara’s) rented a bike from the hotel  and cycled to the beach which was very close like less than 100metres away.after breakfast Yeshara and I (Shenara)  went to the beach with our mum to just roam around. The beach didn’t have anyone but as we walk across the beach we saw more and more people but we didn’t see anyone further than 2 metres of the water.after those 2 metres the water got very dark.which means that even though it is nice and shallow for a bit it drops off sharply in to deep water making it dangerous to go too far.thankfully we stayed on the sand and the shallow water .",
