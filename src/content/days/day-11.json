  "evening": "At 7 o'clock, my mum, Shenara, and I walked to the puppet show. Caitlin had gone beforehand to see the train, where it passes by so close that you could almost touch it. After that, Caitlin quickly came to the puppet show where my mum, Shenara, and I were waiting. We walked up to our seats and the show began. We were so fascinated by the puppet show because it was performed in water! The puppeteers controlled the puppets from behind using long sticks. On the side of the water, there was a band that sang and played traditional cultural music. Although the puppets spoke in Vietnamese, we could still understand what was happening because we could see everything clearly. In the end, it was REALLY fun — I would definitely recommend it! 🎭",
